## NetworkX Centrality

This script takes two arguments: a *graphml* object name and a *string* to name the output:

```
python calculateCentrality.py "smallWorldExample.graphml" "smallWorldExample"
```

Be sure to install and activate *MoNeT* anaconda environment.

```
source activate MASH_Networks
```

## Other Notes

It might be worth looking into *Cytoscape* for visualization.
