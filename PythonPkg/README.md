This module was created to accompany the [MGDrivE](https://marshalllab.github.io/MGDrivE/) and [MoNeT](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MoNeT/) projects to make the analysis of the spatiotemporal simulations of gene-drive spreads as seamless as possible.

##  Project Status

Out code is currently under beta testing by the gene-drive [data analysis team](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MoNeT/Berkeley.html): Biyonka Liang, Gillian Chu, Maya Shen. As well as under intense development by the [dev team](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MoNeT/PythonModule.html): [Héctor M. Sánchez C.](https://chipdelmal.github.io/), Víctor Ferman, and Sarafina Smith.
