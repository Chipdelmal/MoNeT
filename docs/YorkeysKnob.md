## Yorkeys Knob: CRISPR Release

One of the questions we are interested in answering in terms of gene-drives, is the capability these constructs have in spreading across spatial landscapes.

For our realistic tests of the [*MGDrivE*](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MGDrivE/) framework, we chose to run a simulation of releases performed in Yorkeys Knob.

We chose to release in ten nodes of the main cluster (right) and track the transmission of the genes across the landscape.
