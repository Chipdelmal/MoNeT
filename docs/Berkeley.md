# Undergraduate Students Projects (UC, Berkeley)

These projects overlap our wider [landscape analysis](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MoNeT/Networks.html) and [data analysis](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MoNeT/DataAnalysis.html) workflows.

##  [Landscape Aggregation (Gillian Chu)](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MoNeT/LandscapeAggregation.html)


The idea in these sets of experiments is to understand the differences in dynamics of the spread of gene drives in spatiotemporal landscapes, and how these dynamics are affected when we increase the aggregation (clustering) level of the breeding sites.


##  [Gene-Drive Data Analysis Python Module (Sarafina Smith)](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MoNeT/PythonModule.html)

This module was created to accompany the [*MGDrivE*](https://marshalllab.github.io/MGDrivE/) project, although its codebase is totally independent to allow as much modularity as possible. This is not only convenient in terms of the code, but it also provides a clear-cut separation between designing and running experiments, and analyzing the results.


##  [Gene-Drives Data Visualization Python Module (Sarafina Smith)](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MoNeT/DataVisualization.html)

Presenting the results of the data analysis routines in gene flows presents some interesting challenges. In particular, whilst developing and performing analyses for the [*MGDrivE*](https://marshalllab.github.io/MGDrivE/), we realized the need to come up with a toolbox to provide consistent and meaningful ways to visualize the results of our experiments.


##  [Clustering of Directed Networks with Geographical Constraints (Biyonka Liang)](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MoNeT/Community.html)

The main idea for this workflow is to create an algorithm that combines the information of the geographical clustering of a pointset, along with the mosquito movement kernel. The advantage of doing this, would be that it would take into account the mosquito movement part of the dynamics of the disease transmission, while still making it aware that these dynamics are "anchored" to a geographic setting; giving us an informed way to aggregate geographic populations of mosquitos moving on the landscape.
