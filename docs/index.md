---

This project was born to facilitate collaboration in network analysis routines useful for both [*MGDrivE*](https://marshalllab.github.io/MGDrivE/) (__University of California, Berkeley__) and [*MASH*](https://smitdave.github.io/MASH-Main/) (__IHME__) projects. Its main objective at that point was to create a set of tools that allow us to study landscapes in a way that is relevant in terms of mosquito-borne diseases. After some consideration, however, the scope of the project was extended to the development of computational tools to understand understand diseases transmitted by mosquitos. Under this new scope, a new collaboration was born with __Tecnológico de Monterrey__ to develop computer science student projects to aid the study of spatial processes related to mosquito movement.

We are doing this by separating our tasks into three categories:
* __Landscape Analysis:__ These activities revolve around studying the landscape as a part of genes and diseases transmission. Namely, how does the spatial distribution and movement of humands and mosquitoes affect the patterns of genes and bites flows.
* __Data Analysis:__ This is a "support" set of tasks aimed at providing the toolkits necessary to analyse outputs from [*MGDrivE*](https://marshalllab.github.io/MGDrivE/) and [*MASH*](https://smitdave.github.io/MASH-Main/). As such, it involves the development of computationally intensive data analysis and data visualization techniques.
* __Undergraduate Student Projects:__ These projects are aimed at CS and engineering students (in collaboration with faculty at the "Tecnológico de Monterrey" Institute in México) who want to participate in semester-long development of applications to help bring further our understanding of mosquito-borne diseases transmission.
