# Application of Computational Methodologies to Mosquito-Borne Diseases

These projects are the continuation of the thesis project [SoNA3BS](), in which computational methodologies such as agent-based modeling and network theory were applied to the field of mosquito-borne diseases.

## PhD Thesis

**SoNA3BS: An Agent-Based Model to Study High-Resolution Spatial Heterogeneity in Aedes aegypti-Borne Diseases Through the Use of Network Theory.** *Héctor M. Sánchez C., John M. Marshall, Edgar E. Vallejo*

In this thesis work, we explored the usefulness of the combination of agent-based modelling with network theory analysis to understand the fine-scale details of mosquito borne diseases transmission in heterogeneous environments. We used graph theory to compare three mosquito control interventions and to show how these ideas can be extended to a larger analysis framework.
