# Students Projects (UC, Berkeley - Tecnol贸gico de Monterrey Collaborations)

This workflow was created to facilitate the creation of tools to be used as part of the [*MGDrivE*](https://marshalllab.github.io/MGDrivE/) project. It represents the collaboration between UC, Berkeley and Tecnol贸gico de Monterrey in an effort to get undergraduate students involved in mosquito-borne diseases research projects.

## [Mosquito App](./MosquitoApp.html)

This project was developed at "Tecnol贸gico de Monterrey" as part of a collaboration with UC, Berkeley. The aim of the project was to develop a mobile application that was able to capture mosquito sightings with the following information: mosquito photograph, geo-location of the sighting, temperature, and humidity. This information is to be used by research teams to build databases of mosquito presence across different landscapes.
