# Students Projects (UC, Berkeley - Tecnológico de Monterrey Collaborations)

This workflow was created to facilitate the creation of tools to be used as part of the [*MGDrivE*](https://marshalllab.github.io/MGDrivE/) project. It represents the collaboration between UC, Berkeley and Tecnológico de Monterrey in an effort to get undergraduate students involved in mosquito-borne diseases research projects. One of such projects is the  [Mosquito App](./MosquitoApp.html) (follow the link for more information). A full list of the available projects, along with the apps developed by former participants of the projects is available in the following [link](./ToolsCollaboration.md).
