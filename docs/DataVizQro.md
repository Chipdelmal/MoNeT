# [MGDrivE](https://marshalllab.github.io/MGDrivE/) DataViz App

Starting this semester, students from Queretaro will work in teams to develop a cohesive set of tools to display and analyze geotemporal gene-drives information simulated in the [MGDrivE](https://marshalllab.github.io/MGDrivE/) framework. This idea was generated after the pilot test in which several students worked in individual applications and delivered independent projects. A more ambicious, and comprehensive project was planned.
