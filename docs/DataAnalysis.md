# Data Analysis Tools

## [MoNeT-MGDrivE Python Module and Conda Environment](./PythonModule.html)

As our [*MGDrivE*](https://marshalllab.github.io/MGDrivE/) project continued to generate experiments datasets, it became apparent that we needed to create a cohesive framework to perform the analysis of the vast amounts of data we were creating. To accomplish this, we have been translating all of our scattered routines (created in _Mathematica_ for specific experiments), and creating a _python module_ with it's accompanying _conda environment_ so that members of our research group (and potentially, of other research groups) can perform analyses in a standardized way.

## [Gene Drives Visualizations Tools](./DataVisualization.html)

The [*MGDrivE*](https://marshalllab.github.io/MGDrivE/) project has presented interesting challenges in terms of data analysis and visualization. By using _Mathematica_ and _Python_ we have been compiling a toolkit of plots and routines that allow us to analyse and describe the way genes disperse in the enviornment as a consequence of mosquito movement.
