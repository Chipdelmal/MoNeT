## Habitats Spatial Distribution

Although it is widely regarded as important, the thorough study of spatial heterogeneity in mosquito habitats is still a missing piece in our understanding of the spread of gene drives for disease control applications. To tackle this problem, we will look into how an [MCR construct](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6233/442/tab-pdf) spreads in landscapes with varying degrees of heterogeneity in their spatial distribution.
