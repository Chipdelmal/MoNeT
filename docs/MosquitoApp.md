## Mosquito App

This project was developed at "Tecnológico de Monterrey" as part of a collaboration with UC, Berkeley. The aim of the project was to develop a mobile application that was able to capture mosquito sightings with the following information:
* Mosquito photograph
* Geo-location of the sighting
* Temperature
* Humidity

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This work is being carried out by the CS undergraduate student: [Martín A. Molinero M.](https://github.com/MartinMolinero); and it is being developed in its own [github repository](https://github.com/MartinMolinero/mosquito-app)
