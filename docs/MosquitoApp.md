# Mosquito App

This project was developed at "Tecnológico de Monterrey" as part of a collaboration with UC, Berkeley. The aim of the project was to develop a mobile application that was able to capture mosquito sightings with the following information:
* Mosquito photograph
* Geo-location of the sighting
* Temperature
* Humidity

Another feature of the app is that it allows researchers with access to the database, to download all the sightings with all the related information.

## Video Demonstrations

Two videos were recorded with the demonstrations of how the mobile app works. The initial one shows the early stages of development:
