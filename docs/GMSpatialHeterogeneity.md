##  Spatial Heterogeneity Effects on the Spread of Gene Drives

Spatial heterogeneity is widely known to be important for the study of mosquito-borne diseases. However, it has rarely been studied in a systematic way. With the advent of gene-drive systems, the need for understanding these phenomena have become of particular interest so that we can predict and control the spread of genetic constructs across the environment.

Our research group at University of California, Berkeley has already developed a model to simulate the spread of mosquito gene-drives in arbitrary landscapes [MGDrivE](https://marshalllab.github.io/MGDrivE/), so we will use it to simulate and analyse releases of some genetic constructs (starting with the [MCR](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6233/442)).


To tackle this problem, we are proposing to perform a factorial experiment covering the following variables:

### 1) Habitats Distribution

### 2) Population Distribution

### 3) Levels of Aggregation
