##  Habitat Heterogeneity Effects on the Spread of Gene Drives

Spatial heterogeneity is widely known to be important for the study of mosquito-borne diseases. However, it has rarely been studied in a systematic way. With the advent of gene-drive systems, the need for understanding of heterogeneity has become important due to the impact it could have in the prediction and confinability of these constructs in the field.

Our research group at University of California, Berkeley has developed a model to simulate spatiotemporal releases of mosquito gene-drives in arbitrary landscapes: [MGDrivE](https://marshalllab.github.io/MGDrivE/). In this framework we can run controlled experiments of realistic spread of genetic constructs so it makes sense for us to make use of it to simulate and analyze how the genetic modifications spread in landscapes with varying degrees of heterogeneity.

To do so, we plan to take the following steps:
