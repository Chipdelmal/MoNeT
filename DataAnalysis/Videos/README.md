The video generating routines require a background map to be created with the same dimensions as the hexagon overlays.


##  How to use

Right now, the scripts still require a lot of work in terms of automation. Please open the files and change the paths manually according to the comments in the code.

1. Run [mapClusters.py](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/MoNeT/blob/master/DataAnalysis/Videos/mapClusters.py) to generate the background map in the desired style.
2. Run [YKVideo.py](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/MoNeT/blob/master/DataAnalysis/Videos/YKVideo.py)
