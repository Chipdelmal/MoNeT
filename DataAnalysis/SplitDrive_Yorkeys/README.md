# Split Drive: _Yorkeys Knob_

These routines are created for the experiments in the future paper to test the _split drive_ performance in comparison to other drives.

##  Files

* [sortClusters.nb](./sortClusters.nb): Clusters the nodes into two groups so that we can separate _Yorkeys Knob_ from _Trinity Park_ and process them easily in the following routines.
* [selectiveAggregation.py](./selectiveAggregation.py): Performs the "different resolution" aggregation of the landscape (agglomerates all _Trinity Park_ into one node, leaving _Yorkeys Knob_ untouched).
