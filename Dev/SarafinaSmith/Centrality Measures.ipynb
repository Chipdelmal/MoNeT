    "## Network Centrality Measures \n",
    "A brief summary of measures to determine important nodes in a network. In a broad sense, centrality can be classified into radial or medial centrality. Radial centrality measures the walks in a network which start or end at a given vertex (e.g. degree centrality or eigenvalue centrality) while medial centrality measures the walks which pass through a vertex (e.g. betweenness centrality). In this note I focus on medial centrality."

    "### Betweenness Centrality\n",
    "The number of times a node acts as a bridge between 2 other nodes. These summations can be normalized by dividing by $\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}$, the number of edges in a connected graph.\n",
    "#### Shortest Paths Betweenness\n",
    "The number of times the node is on the shortest path between two other nodes. \n",
    "$$c_b(v)=\\sum_{s \\neq t \\neq v \\in V} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v)}{\\sigma_{st}}$$ \n",
    "where $\\sigma_{st}$ represents the total number of shortest paths from s to t and $\\sigma_{st}(v)$ represents the number of shortest paths which pass through v. \n",
    "#### Current Flow Betweenness\n",
    "Also known as random walks betweenness centrality. Consider each edge to have 1 unit of resistance,inject 1 unit of current at source node s and remove it at target node t. Let $I_i^{(st)}$ be the current flowing through vertex i in this process. The betweenness centrality of i is the average of current flow through i over all st pairs. \n",
    "$$c_b(i) = \\sum_{s < t} I_i^{(st)}$$ \n",
    "This can also be modeled as the number of times a random walk from s to t passes through i. It catches vertices that are on many paths but necessarily the geodesic (shortest) ones.\n",
    "#### Edge Betweenness \n",
    "Each of the above types of betweenness can also be calculated on the edges of the graph rather than the vertices."

    "### Communicability Centrality\n",
    "Communicability centrality is a form of betweenness centrality that falls in between the shortest paths and current flow models. Like current flow betweeenness it considers all possible routes, but introduces a scaling so that longer walks carry less importance."
